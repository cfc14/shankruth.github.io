I am Aayush Agrawal, a robotics enthusiast and researcher, currently pursuing my passion for creating innovative solutions in robotics. My journey is fueled by a vision to address day-to-day problems through robust and affordable robotic systems, particularly in dynamic environments like Indian roads and the medical domain.

### Highlights of My Work
- **Autonomous Systems:** Developed and tested Level 5 autonomous institute shuttle systems (Bolt) and proposed affordable vision-based solutions tailored for Indian roads.
- **Surgical Robotics:** Worked on Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Systems, tumor detection, 3D modeling, and ATIR for organ mapping, contributing to a paper submitted to ICRA 2025.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Innovated hyper-realistic simulation methods using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting models, leading to collaborative research projects.

My primary focus lies in bridging the gap between theoretical research and deployable robotics solutions, making a positive impact on lives through technology.

### Key Research Themes
- **Perception and Path Planning for Robotics:** Designed algorithms to improve autonomy in dynamic environments, achieving robust performance in competitions like IGVC and RoboCup.
- **Medical Robotics:** Exploring minimally invasive surgery through soft robotics and autonomous systems, currently working on diffusion policies for surgical applications.
- **Simulation for Testing Autonomous Systems:** Proposed Augmented Reality extensions to bridge the gap between hyper-realistic simulations and real-world testing.
